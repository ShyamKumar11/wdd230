        White space and clean design
      </h2>

      <p>
        White space, also known as negative space, refers to the empty or unused space between elements on a webpage.
        Clean design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and minimalism, often incorporating ample white space to reduce
        clutter and allow content to breathe.
        In web design, white space plays a crucial role in enhancing readability, guiding user attention, and conveying
        a sense of elegance and sophistication.
        Clean design principles prioritize the removal of unnecessary elements and distractions,
        resulting in interfaces that are visually appealing, easy to navigate, and focused on delivering a seamless user
        experience.

      <h2>
        Fitt's Law
      </h2>

      <p>

        Fitt's Law is a principle in human-computer interaction and ergonomics that predicts the time required to
        rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target.
        In web design, this principle suggests that larger and closer elements on a webpage are easier to click or
        interact with.
        Designers often apply Fitt's Law by making important elements, such as buttons or navigation links, larger and
        more prominent, especially on mobile devices where precision may be more challenging.

        PARC: Contrast
      </h2>

      <p>

        In this context, "Contrast" refers to the deliberate differentiation between elements in a design to create
        visual interest,hierarchy, and emphasis. In web design, utilizing contrast effectively involves manipulating
        various design
        elements such as color,size, shape, texture, or typography to make certain elements stand out from others. For
        example, using
        contrasting colors for text and background can enhance readability, while employing contrasting font weights or
        sizes can
        emphasize important information.
        Contrast helps to guide users' attention, differentiate between different types of content, and create a sense
        of hierarchy within a webpage.
        By strategically applying contrast, designers can enhance the visual appeal and usability of their
        designs,ultimately improving the overall user experience.
